## Perceptron

The perceptron models a single artificial neuron. 

* Input vector
* Weights and bias
* Activation function

## Exercise 0

> Implement sigmoid activation.

A perceptron with sigmoid activation is essentially logistic regression, a generalized linear model. It is considered linear because the decision boundary is a line.
